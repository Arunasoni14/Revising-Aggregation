/* Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  
   key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), 
   and the actual average salary.
  Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.
  
  SOLUTION : - 
  SELECT ROUND(AVG(SALARY)) - ROUND(AVG(REPLACE(SALARY, '0','')))
  FROM EMPLOYEES ;

  We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. 
  Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  
  space-separated integers.

SOLUTION : -
SELECT MONTHS*SALARY , COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE
GROUP BY MONTHS*SAALRY
ORDER BY MONTHS*SALARY DESC
LIMIT 1:

Write a query to print the sum of LAT_N and the sum of  LONG_W separated by space, up to 2 decimal places 

*/

--Solution

SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N), 2), ROUND(SUM(LONG_W), 2)
FROM STATION;


/* Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880 and less than 137.2345 . Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

Field	Type
ID	NUMBER
CITY	VARCHAR2(21)
STATE	VARCHAR2(2)
LAT_N	NUMBER
LONG_W	NUMBER
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

SOLUTION : -
SELECT TRUNCATE(SUM(LAT_N),4) 
FROM STATION 
WHERE LAT_N BETWEEN 38.7880 AND 137.2345;
